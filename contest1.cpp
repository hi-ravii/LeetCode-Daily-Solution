// The movies can be grouped together irrespective of their initial order. Determine the minimum number of groups that can be formed such that each movie is in exactly one group.

// Example

// The numbers of awards per movie are awards = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 9, 21, and the maximum allowed difference is k=3.

// One way to divide the movies into the minimum

// number of groups is: • The first group can contain [2, 1]. The maximum

// difference between awards of any two movies is

// 1 which does not exceed k.

// • The second group can contain [5, 4, 6]. The maximum difference between awards of any two movies is 2 which does not exceed k. • The third group can contain [8,9]. The maximum

// difference between awards of any two movies is

// 1 which does not exceed k.
