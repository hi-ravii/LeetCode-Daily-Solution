// You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

// The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

// Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
// Output: 20
// Explanation: 

// We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
// Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
// Example 2:

// Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
// Output: 18
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= points.length <= 1000
// -106 <= xi, yi <= 106
// All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
//Using Prim's algorithm

//This edge will tell from which node to which node i am connected and what's its cost
